    """
    Build a Hamming-weight preserving mixer circuit for QAOA.
    This mixer consists of applying RXX + RYY gates to all pairs of qubits,
    preserving the Hamming weight of the quantum state.

    Args:
        n_items (int): Number of qubits representing the items (first n qubits).
        total_qubits (int): Total number of qubits in the circuit.
        capacity (int): The fixed Hamming weight (i.e., number of qubits that must be in state |1‚ü©).
                        Also used as the number of qubits, assuming weight-1 items in QKP.

    Returns:
        QuantumCircuit: The mixer circuit as a QuantumCircuit object.
